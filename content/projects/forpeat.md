ForPeat is an ambitious research project that will advance science-based approaches to optimise the management of forested peatland. At its core, the project will showcase innovative, sustainable forest practices and nature restoration goals on peat soils, focusing on rewetting and water conservation techniques.

## 🌿 Core Objectives

These demonstrations will serve as **Open Labs**, illustrating how to balance climate positivity with biodiversity enhancement. A key aspect of ForPeat assesses the carbon sequestration benefits of forested peatlands in relation to their management and how forest harvesting impacts:

- **Nutrient cycles**
- **Sediment movement** 
- **Dissolved organic carbon exports** from forest peat soils
- **Biodiversity conservation**

This comprehensive analysis will provide crucial indicators and baselines to maximise climate change mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity conservation.

## 🤖 Innovation & Technology

To stay at the forefront of environmental monitoring, ForPeat will integrate **AI and robotics** into remote-sensing and field-data collection methods. This technological integration enables:

- Continuous monitoring of forest-peatland dynamics
- Automated data collection in challenging environments
- Real-time assessment of restoration effectiveness
- Precise measurement of carbon sequestration rates

## 💰 Scaling & Implementation

ForPeat will explore how these demonstrated activities can be **replicated and scaled up**, with a focus on developing financial incentives under the EU certification framework. This research will translate into practical recommendations for policymakers and land managers.

## 🤝 Multi-Actor Approach

The project is built on collaboration, employing a multi-actor approach that brings together diverse stakeholders:

- **Landowners** and foresters
- **Scientists** and researchers  
- **Public authorities**
- **Industry representatives**

This inclusive strategy ensures all relevant voices are considered throughout the project's lifecycle, aiming to pave the way for a more sustainable, resilient future for forested peatlands.

## Expected Impact

- **Climate mitigation**: Enhanced carbon sequestration in forested peatlands
- **Biodiversity protection**: Balanced ecosystem management strategies
- **Policy guidance**: Science-based recommendations for EU frameworks
- **Economic incentives**: Financial models for sustainable forest management
