TABMON is establishing a transnational acoustic monitoring network to turn large-scale soundscape recordings into biodiversity indicators that matter for conservation policy and management. The project harmonises collection, analysis, and integration of acoustic data so results are comparable across countries and programmes.

## 🎯 Our Mission

Deploy autonomous acoustic sensors across a wide latitudinal gradient in Europe and use AI to transform soundscapes into decision-ready indicators. The aim is to complement existing monitoring and help fill gaps in reporting to EU directives while supporting the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030 targets.

## 🚀 TABMON in a few numbers

**🔬 100 devices deployed**  
From raw audio to species detections, community metrics, and EBV-aligned indicators, with an emphasis on reproducible workflows.

**🌐 15 TeraBytes of high quality acoustic data**  
Data spans Norway, the Netherlands, France, and Spain, representing diverse European habitats.

**📊 A team of 14 experts**  
Our team is composed of recognized researchers specialised in different areas, from AI to field deployment and ecology.

## Key Features

- **Cross-border collaboration**: Harmonized data collection across four European countries
- **AI-powered analysis**: Automated species detection and community metrics
- **Policy integration**: Indicators aligned with EU biodiversity reporting requirements
- **Open science**: Reproducible workflows and data sharing protocols
