## Overview

CarbonViewer is an interactive R Shiny web application that enables researchers, land managers, and policymakers to calculate and visualize carbon storage in peatland ecosystems. This tool bridges the gap between complex scientific models and practical conservation decision-making.

## The Carbon Storage Challenge

Peatlands are among the world's most important carbon reservoirs, storing approximately one-third of global soil carbon despite covering only 3% of Earth's surface. Accurate assessment of peatland carbon storage is crucial for:

- **Climate change mitigation**: Understanding carbon sequestration potential
- **Conservation planning**: Prioritizing peatland protection efforts  
- **Policy development**: Informing carbon credit and offset programs
- **Restoration projects**: Evaluating success of rehabilitation efforts
